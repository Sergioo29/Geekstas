            <h2>Sejo</h2>
            <p>     
                Sejo is the leader of the four main protagonists. In his childhood, Sejo's mother put him on a martial art dojo, so he could
                learn how to protect himself. Since the story is RPG oriented, we can say that Saju is the grappler of the party, having a 
                well-rounded stat tree, and the best defense of the four. His personality is (). He loves to fight, and frequently put the 
                party in danger for not having fears.
                Sejo is the leader of the four main protagonists. In his childhood, Sejo's mother put him on a martial art dojo, so he could
                learn how to protect himself. Since the story is RPG oriented, we can say that Saju is the grappler of the party, having a 
                well-rounded stat tree, and the best defense of the four 
                The son of the founder of Geekcity. His father went on a kind of journey when Sejo was still a baby, the only one who knows the reason was his mother, but she never told her children believing it was better for them to just believe that their father had betrayed her.
                At the age of 8, Sejo joined the Geekcity boxing academy  . There, his teacher, Nasu, saw potential in Sejo, even though he had very negative results in training with the other children. Nasu invited him to a "special training" that would be held on a secret island off the coast of Geekcity.
                Sejo, with his mother's permission, left with Nasu for this island (leaving a substitute teacher teaching in his place). After arriving on the island and having to climb a very high mountain, Sejo arrived at a Buddhist temple, with Nasu revealing his true identity as a master monk. 
                Sejo had a hard time learning the combat discipline of the monks, but his days of effort were rewarded. He learned a technique never before seen in S.A: the ability to manipulate water from his own body! To Sejo that seemed like something useless, but with Nasu's lessons, Sejo was able to create unique movements, coating his fists with water bubbles, with the pressure of the water, his blows were even more powerful. He could also concentrate a massive bubble of water and throw it like a projectile, which despite not being so deadly, could knock out an unsuspecting opponent, as the pressure that the water exerted on this bubble was like a strong slap.
                Upon returning from his training, Sejo was one of the greatest boxers in the gym. His new abilities made him a monster in the ring, winning several championships.
                Sejo is very serious and has never been one to have many friends. In elementary school he was bullied enough to create a psychopathic instinct in him, having to take medication and go to the psychiatrist to get rid of the depression and desire for revenge that surfaced in his heart.
                Sejo created a desire to commit suicide, but fearing the pain of death he thought of secretly poisoning himself. After taking the poison, Sejo discovered that his younger sister, Sara, had disappeared after leaving to visit her grandmother in Nurps. Everyone knew that it was dangerous to leave the city alone, but Sara was still very young and naïve and ended up going (at the time Sejo was 9 years old, and Sara was 4). Even poisoned and knowing that he would die, Sejo went in search of his sister.
                On the way, he found her being attacked by a giant monster, her name was Gurz, an imposing "potency". Sejo was too small to face the monster, and was still weakened by the poison, having to flee with his sister, but preventing the monster from following him and entering the city. After a difficult and tiring race, Sejo, on the verge of death, took Sara back home. 
                Sejo was relieved, and ready to die, but when his sister saw the things he whispered she started crying and screamed at him to stop saying that she loved him. Sejo suddenly felt such happiness that he at that moment decided that he didn't want to die anymore, he knew that his sister, his mother, his family, and maybe other people needed him. Remembering some water manipulation techniques, Sejo began to filter his own blood and cleanse his stomach by filling his belly with water. Incredible as it seemed, he managed to delay the effect of the poison, giving him time to go to the hospital and drain the poison completely. Going back to your normal life.
                Sejo's only friend was Vito, who due to his perverted personality was also not very recognized by the other students. At the end of elementary school, a new student named Kash also became a great friend of Sejo and Vito.
                In high school, the three met Mizo Kunoichi, who also became great friends with them. And lastly, in the same year, a new student named Caty joined Sejo's group of friends, improving his self-esteem and making him happier.

            <img class="kashp" src="images/kash2.png" width=100px alt="Kash Artwork">
            <h2>Kash</h2>
            <p>
                Kash is one of Sejo's best friends. His parents abandoned him and he was taken in by an orphanage, living there until he was 18. Because he had no parents and no discipline, Kash was an outlaw and did knife robberies, but one day he met a kind lady who invited him to live with her in Geekcity. When he came to Geekcity,  he had a very cold way of dealing with things. After he started studying and met Sejo, he ended up getting the hang of him.
                Abandoned by his parents when he was a baby, probably due to financial crisis. He was left on a church`s door and 
                raised for a couple of years by a priest. That church was soon plundered and the bishop got killed by one of the robbers. 
                The gang`s leader found Kashi and decided to take him. Kashi then spent the rest of his childhood and most of his teenage as
                a member of a thieves gang, but decided to leave and leave on his own after gathering some money. The reason for this change 
                of hearth was due to what happened on one of his missions. Kashi was charged with a mission to climb one of the city`s tallest
                mountains, to find a rare bird (creature) nest and steal one of its eggs. Kashi managed to find and reach the nest, but he was
                then attacked by the birds' mother, and Kashi ended up losing the sight of one of his eyes from the bird`s attack. That 
                experience made him remember the teachings of the late priest, so he decided to give up theft. Interesting enough, the gang was
                not that bad at all. The gang taught Kashi most of the school`s material equivalent to what would happen in a elementary school 
                for his age, so Kashi was a smart kid. Kashi then decided to apply for a ordinary high school, and there was when he met Saju and 
                the others. For the RPG`s sake, Kashi is the “thief class. He has the highest speed status of the four.

            <img class="mizop" src="images/mizo3.png" width=100px alt="Mizo Artwork">
            <h2>Mizo</h2>
            <p>
                Mizo, usually called by her surname Kunoichi. Sejo's school friend  and the other heroes of Geekcity.
                She was born into a very simple family, with her little brother, her older sister and her parents. Her father founded a swordsman dojo, since Mizo was more attached to her father, she ended up training her dojo and creating this talent with katanas. His surname was given by his father as well, as he wanted one of his sons to be so skilled that he would be able to become a Ninja one day, he even thought it would be his youngest son, but he saw that the one who would have this gift was Mizo.
                Mizo is a know-it-all. She studied hard as a young woman, and can figure it all out just by analyzing. She is attentive to everything, has a very good vocabulary and is very calm. Despite being quite strong and resistant, Mizo never did well in fist combat, at school, the other students envied Mizo for being very popular for both her beauty and her intelligence, and whenever they fought Mizo ended up getting beaten. Once Mizo even tried to take her katana to school, but was caught on the spot and was suspended for possession of bladed weapons (Sejo, Kash and Vito made fun of her a lot for that). Mizo even tried to train at Sejo's boxing academy, but her punches were like a child's, and she ended up getting hurt by throwing them.

            <h2 class="bolded">Caty</h2>
            <p> 
                Despite having studied at Geekcity school, no one knew where Caty's house was. Caty was a new student at the school who apparently didn't have a name, so because of her cat-like appearance, she was nicknamed Caty, and that name was adopted by everyone. 
                Caty is a peculiar figure in the group, she joined Sejo's group of friends, and her passion was for food, Caty at all times if she wasn't eating she was hungry, and her favorite dish was fish. Something that always worried the other students was why Caty had tail and cat ears that looked natural. Despite having smooth skin like other girls, in her tail and ears hair in the same tone as her hair was born.

            <h2>Vito</h2>
            <p>Vito is one of the "clowns" of the group. He is also a great friend of Sejo and Kash, thus forming a trio of friends. Vito is the "funny" of the group, everything for him is a joke, he is very sarcastic and rarely takes anything seriously.
                When he died, all of Manoel's riches and companies  were passed on to his sister's name. Manoel's sister  married, and Vito was  her son. His father, although faithful to his wife, was always a pervert, and Vito inherited this. Being the son of wealthy parents, Vito never had to worry much about life. Because his parents were always busy taking care of their companies and businesses, Vito also did not have much affection for them, did not know about Manoel or other kinships, always lived alone at home, acquiring a lifestyle similar to Sejo and Kash. 
                Even though she didn't have time for Vito, his mother had a great concern for him, thinking that one day he could leave the city alone and be killed by the "fracions"?, his mother installed in his arms a device that was capable of creating certain spells. Even though he is a vagabond, Vito inherited this intelligence from his parents, so Vito is a "little genius" as well.

            <h2>Clari</h2>
            <p>
                Daughter of the kings of Nurps, thus being a princess (even though she doesn't look like it).
                Since she is the daughter of kings, she was always very spoiled by everyone, but that didn't affect her style much, what affected her was that she didn't leave the castle properly and was always in someone's protection. This made her fearful.
                When she and her parents went to Halabastra she gained a lot of fame for speaking well in public, so she thought she would gain courage if she was alone for a while, the kings ended up, even if doubtful, accepting to leave her there.
                Clari has always liked medicine, she studied a lot in the kingdom about it, thus being a medicinal cleric.
                As time went by, the longing began to come, but she couldn't go out there alone, so the way was to wait for someone to come and pick her up. The kings were so worried about the return of the Geekstas that they ended up forgetting about their daughter, so Sejo and his friends took it upon themselves to bring her back.

                Groak was a friend of King Dom Cruz III even before he inherited the kingdom. Groak saw the birth of Clari and followed her entire life. He was like a second father to her, whenever the king didn't have time to pay attention to his daughter, she turned to Groak. Her goal in life has always been to protect Dom's daughter, whatever the cost.
                After Clari remained in Halabastra, Groak was worried, thinking that she might be killed, but he could not abandon Nurps' guard.

                He is a spearman.
                Something that makes him a unique character is the addiction he has to say "it's logical". Whenever someone says something, they come saying "it's logical!" (It seems that he understands something about the logic of things, but no, it's just a habit of his).
                He is always wide-eyed, no one knows why.

            <p>
                A pirate who claims to be the most feared of the seven seas. Despite being a pirate, Kreget wears heavy copper armor and instead of using a saber, he prefers to use a giant axe.
                Kreget, because he lives on his sailing boat, does not have a specific town to live in, but it is believed that he was born in Icevalley.
                His biggest hobby is kidnapping people and looting, so much so that the deck of his ship is full of slaves and treasures, and one of his greatest treasures was a horse one he found on a mysterious island. This horse had mystical powers capable of memorizing the appearance of any person he was looking at and then transforming into them (just like the Pokémon Ditto). Kreget used this horse several times to deceive people and win battles between other pirate ships.
                One of the people Kreget deceived was Shacaw and Mirella. By making his horse look like Mirella, Kreget induced Ana and Mike to enter his ship, keeping them stranded on deck as slaves. Upon discovering that their children were kidnapped, Shacaw and Mirella went after Kreget's ship and upon finding him, Kreget negotiated to return Ana and Mike at the cost of 10 years of servitude. Shacaw and Mirella accepted the proposal, and served for about two years, when Shacaw tried to rescue his children by force. Kreget when he saw that they were rebelling, grabbed Ana and Mike and threatened to cut off their heads with his axe, Mirella begged Kreget to stop, and he, afraid that their strength would one day bring him more trouble, said that he would spare the children if they "walked the plank", when they found themselves in this situation,  they only asked Kreget for one favor: that he release and leave Ana and Mike in a city; Kreget accepted, so Shacaw and Mirella jumped into the sea together, and Kreget never saw them again, assuming they had died at sea.

            <h2>Manoel Crux / Master Cracker </h2>
            <p>
                The whole story of The Geekstas begins in Manoel's childhood. 
                He is the former leader of MCP. The son of mechatronic engineers, Manoel apparently had a good childhood. He studied at the best school in the city. His best friend, Alpha, in turn, was an orphan and poor. Manoel was the nerd of the class, innocent, a favorite of the teachers and hated by the other students. But even though the other students didn't like him, Manoel was always safe at school, because Alpha protected him from everyone, Alpha was the biggest in the class, quarrelsome and strong. 
                Manoel's parents did not let Alpha go to their house because they had a certain prejudice, thinking that he would be some criminal, so Manoel asked to go to Alpha's house, and with a certain fear his parents allowed it. Manoel, whenever he went to the Alpha neighborhood,  was impressed by the situation of the people there. He often saw scenes of robbery, shootings, kidnappings, saw groups of people taking drugs, in short, all kinds of social problems, and that seemed normal to Alpha.
                Manoel created a certain fear in society since then, he thought that the world was dirty, not only with garbage, but with bad people. For Manoel, the world had no future, it would soon become an uninhabitable place. Since then, Manoel has created the dream of finding another planet to live on. Manoel also decided which college he would attend: biology; because he wanted to discover ways to improve the human species. Now, Manoel's ideas seemed crazy, some kind of utopia, but he remained firm, did a doctorate in biology and began to earn very well at work and get rich. He bought a spaceship and created MCP.  
                While living in the MCP, Manoel went crazy: instead of saving, he wanted to annihilate humans because he thought they were too inferior. After trying to kill MCP herself  for contradicting him, he was killed. 
                After dying, Manoel was resurrected with a new body, his name is now Master Cracker, with the ability to hack even the world. 
                Her black trage with a hooded scarf with a white sphere-shaped button, her pale white skin, and her electronic sunglasses with her straight silver hair back make up her look. Master has created his own combat weapon, a bracelet that emanates a broad blade of electricity called the Deleter.

            <h2>Alpha</h2>
            <p>
                Alpha is the New leader Of MCP, He is an android. His physical strength is incredible, similar to the Dejoke, He can throw people away with one arm. He is the strongest of the group, fighting without the need for equipment or weapons. His bionic eyes are capable of copying the opponent's movements or speeches, so Alpha is also a very intelligent man. For reasons of honor and example, he never takes off his mask. Her blue hair stands on end back and her underwear rimmed jeans are her underwear insiders. Despite not using weapons, Alpha can shoot his fists through a thruster and chain inside his arms. 	
                Alpha was the "hot-blooded" boy at school, he fought with anyone who messed with him, no matter who it was. One of these fights was with a gang boy, who arranged with his gang to catch Alpha alone at night to lynch him, but Alpha was very skilled and managed to handle everyone by himself. 
                It was then that they plotted something worse: when Alpha was riding in a car (yes he was young but he already knew how to drive without a license), they planned an accident, plunging a truck into his car. Alpha was unable to swerve and hit the truck full, but the truck driver had already jumped out and was not injured. Alpha violently hit his face on the windshield and fainted for a few minutes, meanwhile his car started to catch fire, when Alpha woke up he saw that his face was all cut and bleeding a lot, in addition to the fire that had burned his body a lot as well. His legs and arms had been broken by the wreckage of the car. The only thing he could do was rest his face on the steering wheel with his head projected to the outside of the car. After a few minutes silent in the burning car, Alpha said: "why am I still alive?", the car refused to explode and there was no one nearby to help him. Seeing the state Alpha was in, and that he was still alive, the boys of the gang felt bad and decided to help him by taking him to the hospital. Alpha was from the same school class as Manoel, they were friends, and when Manoel learned that his friend was hospitalized on the verge of death, he was worried. Luckily, Manoel's parents  were professional scientists and Manoel asked them to help him. Alpha was bleeding heavily, he had been hit in vital organs, the hospital's resources made it impossible to have effective surgery to save him in time. If it weren't for Manoel's parents, Alpha would have died. 
                Alpha was taken to the laboratory of Manoel's parents, who began to implant electronic devices to cover gaps in his body. But while the implants were made, other systems were affected, it was then realized that Alpha's vision had been lost, making it necessary to implant robotic eyes... Realizing that Alpha was no longer so human, the two scientists began to use creativity and fulfill their dream: to create an android.

                Beta is a champion of muay thay and capoeira. He has a hobby of being a surfer. Despite looking like an ordinary guy, Beta has an incomparable kick, the power of his legs is superior to anyone. Her clothes are very relaxed, her trademark is her flip-flop and orange jacket with flower designs. As a young man, Beta loved to run away from school to go surf on the beach with friends, but one day he wanted to go deeper into the water, his friends hesitated, but he still kept going. When he reached a certain point it was no longer possible to see the bottom of the water, it was then that a shark attacked him, he tried to call for help but there was no one around. 
                The shark bit one of his arms that was almost mutilated, Beta was a good swimmer and the shark was not that big, giving them a chance to fight, Beta was hit in the other arm after trying to use the board as a weapon, it was then that a fisherman who was passing by heard the noises and went towards him,  luckily he had a harpoon, and with a precise movement Beta immobilized the shark for a moment, allowing room for a fatal shot from the harpoon. Even after being treated at the hospital, Beta's arms continued to have bite marks (which even appeared to be tribal tattoos), and his cheek was left with a mark from the graze of the harpoon. Amazingly, he continued with his hobbies.

            <p>
                The greatest karate fighter of the century. She wears bandages in her mouth and a Chinese hat she got from her father, who put her in the foreign martial arts academy. 
                Because she didn't know how to speak the language of the country she was in, Gama was bullied by the other students, but her father was so proud that she didn't tell him so as not to hurt him. But Gama grew so much in that academy that the other students became jealous and plotted to get her to fight the big student in the class. They put the big guy and her on the mat, and despite being afraid, Gama accepted the challenge. 
                She fought with everything she had, but when she was caught in an immobilizing blow followed by a well-aimed blow to the throat, Gama fainted. When she was taken to the nearest hospital, it was found that she had become permanently mute, as her vocal folds had been ruptured. But this, contrary to what it seems, made her more determined in her fights. Gama won several karate championships, being known as "the silent kick", his breaking blow  served as a reference to several other fighters for being the strongest to date. After entering the MCP, Manoel said he could try to restore Gama's speech, but afraid of surgery she denied it and preferred to remain mute. But Manoel still wanted to help her and designed a little guide robot that walked with Gama and translated his sign language into speech.

            <h2>Shacaw</h2>
            <p>
                One of the greatest soldiers of the century, Shacaw has skills with any firearm. Her appearance is beautiful, her red hair and her light brown leopard-like eyes draw the attention of young women throughout the Smart Archipelago. His red coat with playing card symbols scattered around him that he wore when he was a magician and his custom clown pants that he wore when he worked at the circus, and his arsenal of weapons spread across his body, usually consisting of a mini-gun machine gun strapped around his waist, a ranged rifle on his back,  Two revolvers, one on each side in his holsters, a fanny pack of grenades and an army camouflage cloak hidden inside his coat. He also has an impressive drive, second only to the Needles family. 
                Since he was a child, his dream was to serve in the army. At the age of 18, because he was a young man of great stature and very athletic because he attended the gym from an early age, he impressed the military after doing, even with difficulties, 100 push-ups with a recruit on his back. 
                After 2 years as a soldier corporal, he was recognized and graduated to sergeant of his brigade. In his first war he won, losing only 7 soldiers (this number was marked for him, that's why he always walks with 7 grenades in memory of these soldiers) managing to reconquer a region that was dominated by barbarians. After making a dignified grave for the 7 brave soldiers and a prayer for their families, Shacaw and his brigade celebrated the victory with a good barbecue. Upon receiving the news, his superiors requisitioned Shacaw, graduating him to 1st lieutenant and giving orders to command his platoon to one of the militia's most difficult missions: the battle against the aliens of the Arctic. 
                Shacaw was confident, confident too much, his soldiers also trusted him to the point of being in agreement with any order from him. Shacaw made a fairly precise plan, but he didn't count on the size of the enemy army.
                Shacaw was on the front line in the war, armed to the teeth and well protected, Shacaw denied all the attacks made against him, but the vision he had was horrible: his soldiers began to be repelled, those who remained were frightened and fled towards Shacaw asking for help while being hit in the back and killed. The bravest fought with everything they had. 
                By Shacaw's side was his best friend: Mike. Mike was a friend that Shacaw had known since the two of them joined the military. The two were always together. Shacaw met Mike's family, a poor but happy family. His wife, Ana, loved it when Shacaw visited them, Shacaw said that Ana's food  was the best. Mike was quite happy to learn of Shacaw's graduations in the army, although he was not so lucky. But by becoming Lieutenant Shacaw obviously put Mike in his platoon as leader of the attack squad, staying by his side. 
                When Shacaw saw that he was losing the war, he gave the soldiers a flight command, but the enemy army had already surrounded them, he also tried to surrender, but the leader of the enemy army was butcher and bloodthirsty and did not accept the request to surrender. 
                Overcome with hatred, Shacaw left his platoon for a moment and went up to the enemy army and began to use the maneuver called Desperado: he took his two revolvers and began shooting around at incredible speed. But Shacaw, even strong, was only one, and he couldn't kill all the enemies alone. When he saw that he had his guard open, Shacaw closed his eyes and waited for death, but to his surprise he only heard gunshots, but nothing hit him. When he opened his eyes, he was faced with his first nightmare, Mike was in front of him totally shot, he had thrown himself in front of Shacaw to save him. Before he died, Mike said, "Captain, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to abort the mission... Take care of Ana for me." 
                Shacaw took Mike by the shoulders and started running desperately among the enemy soldiers, but his agility was such that they couldn't hit him, he ran to the relief party of his platoon, but when he got there he had his second nightmare, his platoon was no more, everyone was dead, only one fallen soldier could still see him and spoke with difficulty:  "Captain, where were you captain!?" and received another shot and died.
                Shacaw couldn't hold back his tears. He was alone in the midst of his army of dead soldiers. Mike, his best friend, died on his shoulders, and died to save him from his own mistake in trying to contain the enemies alone. After almost freaking out at seeing all that, Shacaw began to use several weapons at once, shouting "DO YOU WANT ME? SO COME AND GET IT," his face was frightening, so much so that the enemy army became afraid and began to retreat. Shacaw took a bullet from the gun that was with Mike and said: "this is for you Mike" and with that bullet killed their leader with a precise shot from almost 500m away. Shacaw used the radio to ask for a rescue from the HQ, which even though it took 30 minutes to arrive, found Shacaw alive and unharmed (at least in the body) and took him back to the HQ. 
                Shacaw then resigned from the army. 
                When he went to tell Ana about what had happened to her husband Mike, Shacaw had her third and complete nightmare: Ana , horrified by the news, ran to the drawer and pulled out a pistol that she and Mike kept there for safety, but when she pointed it at Shacaw, she actually shot herself in the head and died.
                Shacaw, after several months of treatment at the psychiatrist, married a girl named Mirella and began working in the circus as a magician. He had two children, and named them Ana and Mike, in memory of his soldier friend and his wife, saying that the promise would extend to the children of Shacaw to protect them.

            <h2>Mirella</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best archers of the century. His parents were biologists who went on safari in the forests to learn more about the fauna there. In her childhood, on one of the farms, there was a terrible storm where an earthquake split the road where Mirella's parents' truck passed. When they tried to brake sharply, Mirella was thrown out of the truck, falling into the crevice.
                Her parents ran to try to save her, threw a rope, shouted her name, but it seemed that the hole was too deep. Bewildered and not knowing what to do, Mirella's parents left the place and returned home, believing that their daughter had died.
                As she fell into the crevasse, Mirella hit a branch and then a pile of leaves, which was like a cushion. When she came back to consciousness, Mirella found herself surrounded by a kind of "fractions" similar to monkeys, but which behaved like people. Mirella was in a village, which despite being thousands of meters below the ground, had vegetation, as rich as the ones we know, a lake of crystal clear waters, trees with palm trees so large that their foliage served as roofs.
                These monkeys seemed to be very intelligent, and they took a liking to Mirella, taking care of her as one of her young. As she grew older, Mirella learned the language of that species, so they taught her the method of communication of most animals, and also taught her how to handle bows and crossbows for combat.
                When she was grown up, Mirella remembered her old parents, and told the story to the leader of the monkeys, asking if there was a way to get out of there to return to the surface. Sad to see that she wished to leave, but knowing that it was necessary, he showed her the way to a way out.
                Upon arriving in the city, Mirella returned to her parents' house. To his surprise, his house had become a bazaar, all his things (even the intimate ones) were for sale. Her parents, believing that Mirella had passed away, were getting rid of all their belongings so as not to feel so sad. When Mirella saw people seeing and buying her personal things, she was overcome with such shame that it made her feel ashamed of everyone. 
                Upon seeing her parents, they almost fainted when they saw their daughter alive, and already grown. After a strong hug, Mirella told everything that had happened, and her life returned to normal.
                After a while, Mirella met Shacaw and the two fell in love and soon married. Seeing the talent that Shacaw had with ranged weapons, his skills with bows and arrows began to return, making the two train together and thus become incredibly accurate in their shots.

                Clea is the best maid of the century. In addition to being admirably beautiful, she was recognized for being very agile in her cleaning. She broke the Guinness Book of World Records for being able to clean a 10-room house in just 1 minute without leaving a trace of dirt visible.
                Clea also has a knack for making great food.
                However, behind these talents there is a sad story. Clea is the daughter of slaves. His mother was a renowned political leader who fell in love with a man who after getting married discovered that he was one of the hackers from another country. 
                After the beginning of the War, her husband was discovered and sentenced to death, but Clea's mother did not accept this and tried to justify his actions. With her senate and voters being against the hacker's freedom, they removed her from her position and also sentenced her to death, both of them having to flee the country. 
                After arriving in another country, the two had to serve for the bourgeoisie there in order to survive, ensuring their safety in the midst of the war.  It was in the meantime that Clea was born and raised. When Clea reached a certain age, she was separated from her parents and sold at auction for the profit of the family that her parents were slaves to.
                Clea, a child, being the only servant and having to take care of an entire mansion by herself, spent her entire youth in this life. Until at the age of 20 he planned an escape and returned to his parents, who had already gained the trust of the family in which he worked and were in a slightly better life.

            <h2>Dejoke</h2>
            <p>
                Dejoke had a hard life. Father of many children and his wife died of cancer, his profession was mechanic, but his earnings were not enough to support his family. Her children lived sad and crying. So he, in addition to being a mechanic, became a clown, going to birthday parties for several children, while his own were at home crying. From working for so long, he created permanent dark circles.
                He received a proposal from the government to earn good money, but after accepting he saw that he was to be a test subject for toxic substances. His body reacted in several absurd ways, first his body became very strong, his height doubled, and most incredibly, his eyes emanated a light. After hours in the gas room, he fell to the floor, apparently dead, but after a few seconds his mouth moved and said "What did you do to me?". 
                Seeing what had happened, the government was enchanted by it. But when you tried to use the same gases on other people, they died instantly. The scientists were puzzled: "Why did Dejoke's body react like this and the others' didn't?"
                Another problem was that a catalyst had been created from those gases in Dejoke's lungs, and he exhaled that gas when breathing and speaking, it was necessary for him to use something that filtered it, so they created a kind of "reverse gas mask" for him.
                In reality, that test that Dejoke passed was of a secret government organization to create nuclear bombs to be used in the War, but when they discovered that they used live human guinea pigs, the Justice of S.A . abolished the operation and collected all the containers they had of the gas. The only container left was Dejoke himself, but even with the proposals that the government made he refused to cooperate and returned to his home. 
                He knew he was no longer the same, but he would not stop seeing his children because of that. 
                When his little children saw him, they were very afraid, thinking that he was some evil monster. When he played some jokes that was usual and when he closed his eyes and showed his dark circles, his children recognized him, and the eldest said "daddy why are you so high and ugly?", Dejoke gave a forced laugh and said "it's just that daddy ate spoiled food", and they innocently believed him and liked him again. 
                Dejoke could no longer work as a clown, but he could continue to be a mechanic. Dejoke suffered when walking in the streets; People kept looking at him in amazement and whispering among themselves. But somehow this helped him to be recognized, being one of the most well-known mechanics of the time, with several nicknames: "giant", "Jason", "Gorilla", "masked man", people prescribed it to anyone who needed it.

            <h2>Shadow Gamar</h2>
            <p>
                Best known for just Shadow G. The only people who know the meaning of the G. in his name are his wife and son. Shadow Gamar is an evil entity found at the gates of the underworld. Whether his function was really the "gatekeeper" is not certain. 
                When he saw Manoel Crunx coming towards the gates, he approached and questioned him. Shadow was very interested in Manoel's story  and made a deal with him. 
                Shadow G, despite not having a post in the underworld, had incredible powers far superior to any other person's, his uniqueness was the ability to polymorphize; he could transform into any kind of animal or creature.
                Despite looking like a heartless monster, Shadow G has family ties. His wife, Flake, was a beautiful Asian nymph who was sentenced to death and ended up meeting Shadow in the underworld. There they married and had a son, named Lasher.
                Shadow G, just like his entire family, did not possess a physical body, he had the ability to go to Earth to tempt humans, but could not interact with them, and Shadow did not like this situation, preferring to stay in the underworld.
                Something interesting in his afterlife is that after seeing so many famous singers pass through the gates of the underworld, Shadow began to acquire passion and even talent with music, having the habit of rhyming talk.

                Upon arriving in the underworld, Flake adopted a human form.
                When Flake met Shadow G., the two fell in love and married, but Flake never told the truth about his whereabouts. She made up the story that it was a nymph who was murdered, to convince him that she really looked that way. 
                Despite having a draconic transcedence, his son, Lasher, was born with a human appearance.
                Upon receiving a body and returning to Earth, Flake secretly asked Manoel to  use the genes of her old dragon body as a base, which resulted in a "half-and-half" body.

                Son of Shadow Gamar and Flake. 
                Lasher since he was a baby has always shown talent with blades, and even at a young age he carries several swords with him. His dream was to be the next Soul Reaper, but instead of wearing a scythe and a black hood, he would wear a sword and Samurai armor. 
                Life in the underworld is very difficult, Lasher doesn't understand many feelings; Even though he has a father and mother, he does not know what love, hate, happiness, sadness is, etc. That is why his face is always neutral.
                Time in the underworld passes very slowly (just like on Novatera (the name of the planet that the MCP rules)), 1 year on Earth would be approximately 100 years in the underworld. So, Lasher, despite appearing to be young, has lived much longer than the adults on Earth.
                With the interbreeding of his parents, Lasher inherited his father's strength, and his mother's draconic abilities.
                One of its combat particularities is its flex katanas; swords that change size to hit targets farther away.
