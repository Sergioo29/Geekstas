            <h3>VS MISTER ALPHA – The Geekstas 2 – Ch. 3   </h3>
            <p>PLAYER: SHACAW   DIFFICULTY: Medium</p>
            <p>SCENE SUMMARY: After a meeting between the members of GKT, Shacaw is forbidden to go to Icevalley to monitor the guard of Novaterra. Shacaw does not accept and says that he will go to Icevalley to save his children or he will leave MCP. Alpha argues with him and Shacaw prepares to leave, when he feels Alpha's hand on his shoulders. With an outburst of rage, Shacaw draws his pistol and shoots back towards the hand, when he sees that Shacaw was still sitting and had thrown his fist, he is pulled by the chains close to Alpha, who punches Shacaw in the face, says something impactful and starts the fight.
                FIGHT: Alpha will remain in the middle of the scenario, separating it into platforms. When trying to approach Alpha, he will lunge and push the player away, dealing damage.
                Alpha's moves will change according to the remaining health, and the start of the match will have the background music accompanied by his moves, to give more excitement to this boss.
                
                VICTORY TACTIC: The player will have to hit certain points on the map for a trap to fall on one of the platforms. Then you'll have to taunt Alpha by shooting him in the back. When Shacaw tries to pull the player he will have to make him pull the trap in place.
                Important: Some traps will deal damage, others will only immobilize Alpha, giving the player time to approach and strike Alpha.

            <h3>VS   DEJOKE  – The Geekstas 2 – Ch. 4</h3>
            <p>PLAYER: KASH   DIFFICULTY: High</p>
            <p>SCENE SUMMARY: Upon arriving at the factory of fraccions, the heroes end up separating, and the one who manages to reach the central room is Kash. When he gets there, he finds Dejoke repairing a machine. While trying to break the factory's motherboard, Dejoke stops it, pulling out one of the pipe pipes from the room's gas system, leaving everything cloudy.
                FIGHT: With difficulty seeing, the player will have to be guided by the sounds of Dejoke (the sounds of the machines will get in the way) and the sparkle of his eyes. Dejoke will use the barrel he ripped off to attack Kash, and will also dash and teleport through the smoke.
                VICTORY TACTIC: The player will have to use Dejoke's weapon against him. When Dejoke throws the pipe and misses the player, he will pick it up, but the player may hit other pipes to confuse Dejoke in where the pipe fell. In the meantime, the player will be able to attack Dejoke's backpack.
                Important: This tactic will only work until Dejoke completely loses his backpack. Then he will take it out and fight emanating the poisonous gas. In this part the player will have an estimated time to find the plastic pipes and cut them with his dagger, releasing a jet of water that will dissipate the gas. When the gas runs out, the fight ends.

                FIGHT: Shadow G. will have three moments. The first he will be the focus, turning into different types of animals and Master Cracker will hinder the player by throwing lightning. 
                In the second moment Shadow G. will transform into a monster with bladed claws, where he will be indestructible and the player will have to focus on Master Cracker, who will be difficult to hit, but in return will "be defeated" in 1 hit.
                In the third moment, everyone will be transferred to somewhere in space, where Shadow G. will transform into his ultimate form.
                VICTORY TACTIC: In the first two moments it will be more of a puzzle, where there will be someone getting in the way of the player finding his target.
                In the third moment, the player will be attacked by Shadow G. both from the front and below the stage. And it is at the moment when Shadow G. appears below the scenario that the player will have a chance to hit each of his limbs and deal damage.
